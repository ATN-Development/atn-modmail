# Overview
ATN ModMail is an open source ModMail bot made by EightâˆžðŸ’”. This modmail is completely customizable and a very easy to use bot. It doesn't require coding knowledge also except just configuring certain values.

[Installation](#installation) is also very easy. Configuring the bot with custom messages just requires basic variable assign knowledge.

**The features are:**

- Snippets
- Custom Emoji Reaction
- Customizable Open and Close Ticket Messages
- Ticket Transcripts

# Prerequisites
When using the bot, you must have done the following:
- Installed [Node.js on their official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Installed the `typescript` npm package by using 
```powershell
npm install -g typescript
```
in the [terminal](#notes)*

# Installation
Configure the bot settings by making changes in `config.example.ts` and `snippets.example.ts`. After configuring, change the file names to `config.ts` and `snippets.ts` and then type in `npm run start`in terminal where **location must be the bot directory**.

If you are getting an error called 
```powershell
Error: Authentication failed
```
you need to save the file using the shortcut `Ctrl` + `S`. If you did not save the file, there will be a white ball at the left/right of the filename at the top of the screen, as you can see from the screenshot below.
